`Survey` button opens the single entity of the table which can be modified to
fulfill the session metadata. In the `Survey` table, `survey` attribute list
values come from the `SurveyType` table, `shipName` attribute list values come
from the `Boat` table.

`SurveyType`, `Transect`, `Boat` and `Plateform` buttons open their tables
dialog as each can contains more than one entity.

Espiecially for `Transect` table, it is possible to import a linear layer
(EPSG:4326). The imported layer must have the same attribute names as the
`Transect` table (transect,strate,subRegion,length). Transect entity reference
will be available in the `Environment` table.

done by using the ``Shift+s`` shortcut.

Futhermore the validation button includes the validation feature, that is used
to flag entities as verified. This feature should be used at the end of the
acquisition day, to check records without being in the rush. By default, it will
validate all records, after checking that environnement records are valids, but
user can also select entities in environment/sighting/follower tables to only

At the end, there is also two filters that can be activated to filter
environment/sighting/follower tables. It can be useful to do the entity check.
